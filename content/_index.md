# Hello, I'm Zachary Meyer

I am a software developer that has a deep fascination with video games, often exploring them through reverse engineering to uncover potential expoits and build tools to automate gameplay. Alongside my daily work, I have many several side projects, including a terminal-based text editor, programming language, and even a couple of games (that will never see the light of day).

When I am not looking at a screen, I like to spend my time with my beautiful wife, 3 dogs, and 2 cats. Yes, we have an insane amount of pets and they're awesome.

## Current Work: Scaling Data Management for Machine Learning

I am currently focused on building and refining data management tooling to support modeling at scale. My role involves streamlining the entire data lifecycle, from collection and cleaning to pre-processing and readiness for model training. By building tools that scale, my goal is to simplify the complex process and enhance the reliability of data pipelines for ML apps.
